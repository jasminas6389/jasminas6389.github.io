            <p>The project was made using Git and GitHub. We had to make a project on any type of adventure, we were allowed to pick whatever we wanted. My partner and I both had interest in solving crimes, we were paired together to work on the project. The title of our project is "Solving a Murder". </p>
            <p>This project is about solving a murder that has occurred. The suspects are the Neighbor, the Father, and the Friend, you must choose who is guilty based on evidence. It's up to you to figure it out. One wrong move and an innocent person goes to jail, and the murderer is set free. For the project we needed a Google Drawing plan, with a key that is color-coded to show which partner is doing what. We needed a README, a minimum of 10 files, and all the links have to work otherwise the player wouldn't be able to progress in the game, and they won't be able to continue. </p>
            <p>My teacher assigned this project to show that we understand everything he has taught us in Unit 2, which is GitHub. So making a project using GitHub will show our understanding of this topic. He also wanted us to gain more experience with these tools, because we will keep using it later on. This project allowed me to practice, using directories, md files, and linking one file to another. One difficulty I faced in this project was getting started at first, my partner made all the files and I felt I wasn't contributing much but then after we made the plan. It was easy because we both knew what we had to do. For my parts I would confirm with my partner if what I wrote was good or if I should change anything. Then she would give me feedback, I would write it down. I feel communication is key because it is both of our projects and we should both have a say in how it's done. Something I would do differently would be to check the requirements as we go so we wouldn't miss any files that were needed. If we had more time I feel we might have done the extra credit because yes it will bring up the grade, but it would also make the project seem cooler. With scary images that relate to the project, and having creepy fonts. </p>
